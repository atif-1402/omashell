# Omashell - Alpha Version
Omashell is a Quickshell configuration built to feel native on Omarchy OS by DHH. It ships a polished bar, launcher, OSD, settings, and media experience that matches Omarchy’s riced defaults and tooling out of the box. It’s intentionally minimal, fast, and customizable without breaking the visual identity.

## Installation

> ⚠️ **Warning**
> This setup modifies your Hyprland configuration. **Backup your configs before continuing.**
> Do **not** blindly overwrite configs unless you know what you are doing.

### Dependencies

Install required packages:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed quickshell cava cliphist wl-clipboard imagemagick jq
```

### Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atif-1402/omashell.git
cd omashell
```

### Backup existing configuration (Recommended)

```bash
cp -r ~/.config/quickshell ~/.config/quickshell.backup 2>/dev/null
cp ~/.config/hypr/bindings.conf ~/.config/hypr/bindings.conf.backup 2>/dev/null
```

### Install Quickshell config

Copy the quickshell configuration:

```bash
cp -r config/quickshell ~/.config/
```

### Install Omashell keybinds (Manual merge recommended)

Open:

```
config/hypr/bindings.conf
```

Copy the Quickshell binds and **manually paste them at the end of your:**

```
~/.config/hypr/bindings.conf
```

This avoids breaking existing keybind setups.

### Install helper scripts

```bash
cp local/bin/* ~/.local/bin/
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/qs.sh
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/wb-kill.sh
```

### Start Quickshell

Run:

```bash
~/.local/bin/qs.sh
```

or use the provided keybind:

```
SUPER + SHIFT + Q
```

### Notes

* Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your `$PATH`
* Restart Hyprland if binds don't work
* Manual config merging is intentional to prevent overwriting user setups
* Designed for Hyprland rice setups (Omarchy tested)

### Troubleshooting

Verify quickshell runs:

```bash
quickshell
```

Check IPC:

```bash
quickshell ipc list
```

Verify scripts:

```bash
ls -l ~/.local/bin
```

## Status (Alpha)
